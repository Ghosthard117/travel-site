# Travel site
The Travel Site project is a showcase of a meticulously crafted travel website, developed with a mobile-first strategy. Leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS, I focused on achieving a responsive design that adapts seamlessly across various devices. I tackled challenges such as image responsiveness and flex property utilization to enhance UI flexibility. By employing a combination of global CSS and Tailwind configurations, I optimized code efficiency and reduced redundancy. Additionally, React and TypeScript were instrumental in structuring the UI, promoting component reusability, and ensuring code reliability through type safety.
